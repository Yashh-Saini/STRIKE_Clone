I successfully built the **STRIKE Clone** using **HTML & CSS only!** 🎉

## 💡 Project Overview
This project was created as part of the **Defense Second Hackathon**, where I challenged myself to replicate the **STRIKE website** using pure HTML and CSS — no frameworks, no JavaScript.

Through this project, I:
- Learned and applied new **web structure** concepts  
- Enhanced my understanding of **styling principles** and **responsive design**  
- Practiced **clean code**, **semantic HTML**, and **CSS best practices**  
- Improved my **attention to detail** in front-end design
